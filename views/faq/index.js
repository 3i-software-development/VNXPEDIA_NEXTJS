                <h4>Do I need a visa?</h4>
                <p>All Australian passport holders will require a visa to enter Vietnam. There are 3 ways to apply for Vietnam visa.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Option 1: Via local Vietnam embassy or consulate
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Option 2: E-Visa through government website https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Option 3: A travel agent can apply on your behalf.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We recommend the 2nd option as this is the most convenient (Unless you require multiple entries and wish to stay for more than 30 days). The processing time is roughly about 3 days for E-Visa. Visa is valid for 30 days from the date you enter the country (A single entry only)</p>

                <h4>When is the best time to visit?</h4>
                <p>Weather in Vietnam is somewhat complex due to the shape and geography of the country. In general, between March and April is probably the best time to visit if you would like to cover north, Central and south. Each area weather can be distinct based on the month you wish to travel. For travelling north, weather is best during March to April and September to November. For south, the dry season between November and April is the best. If you would like to enjoy the beach weather, then it will depend where you want to visit.

                <h4>How long should you spend in Vietnam?</h4>
                <p>
                    This will depend what parts of the country you intend to cover. If you would like to visit north, central and south, we recommend between 17 to 20 days, so you can travel at a leisure pace. If you only intend to cover the north and central, between 10 to 12 days would be sufficient enough. All our tours are tailor made to suit your requirements hence we can build an itinerary considering your budget, places you wish to visit and length of your intended stay.</p>

                <p>Firstly, it is best to decide which key city you plan to fly into and fly out of Vietnam. Also, it will depend on which city you will fly from Australia.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Fly direct to Ho Chi Minh city
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Fly direct to Hanoi

                    <br />

                    <br />
